# Personal Website
I created this website as a personal portfolio to showcase my background, work experience, projects, and skills. This allowed me to gain hands on experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Furthermore, I focused heavily on interface design, smooth transitions, and ease of navigation. 

My logo and the graphic on my website were created with Canva and LucidChart!
